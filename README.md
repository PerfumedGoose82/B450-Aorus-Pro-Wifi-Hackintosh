# B450-Aorus-Pro-Wifi-Hackintosh
Hackintosh WIP, might update when done to help other people on the internet but I can not promise that I will
# specs:
Motherboard: B450 Aorus pro wifi

Cpu: 5800x3d

Gpu: 6700xt (disabled)

Gpu: 580 2048sp (flashed to 570 bios)

Ram: 3200mhz 2x16 + 2x8 g.skill ripjaws V (dont worry, they are the same spec just different sizes)

ssd: samsung 980 2TB (i have others, but they are irrelavent cuz I'm not installing to them)

# Kexts:
go find them in the directory, im too lazy to put them here.
# note
im unable to include basesystem.dmg since it exceeds github's 25MB limiit, but it loads into the environment just fine so I dont think that it is the issue
